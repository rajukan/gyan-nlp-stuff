NMF is a factorization of a non-negative data set $V$: $$ V = W H$$ into non-negative matrices $W,\\; H$. Often positive factors will be **more easily interpretable** (and this is the reason behind NMF's popularity). \n",

How does caring and\\nconcern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers\\nto you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,\\nthen you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid\\nof your emotions.\\n\\nAnd I do have a good reason to believe what I do.\\n\\n\\n>When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead\\n>of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity\\n>decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.\\n\\nThe topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my\\nGod says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have\\nlife forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal\\ntorment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to \\nlive it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that\\nwas the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It\\'s\\nwishful thinking.\\n \\n>Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling\\n>that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable\\n>place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and\\n>holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little\\n>sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you\\'re proud of it.\\n\\nIs this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most\\npeople, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they\\nare imperfect.  Is \"the world an undesireable place\" a doctrine\\nof Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does\\nKendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?\\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  \\nMine doesn\\'t.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the\\npriest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn\\'t.  Is this\\na bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being \\nignorant of the Bible?\\n\\nBrian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.\\nYou would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don\\'t follow Kendigianism.\\nI follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance\\nof Christ and the Bible in regards to \"priests\",  have you not read about\\nthe sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the\\npurpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should\\nNOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do\\nnot follow Catholicism or any \"ism.\"  I follow Christ.\\n\\n>Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your\\n>failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you\\'ve led\\n>as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you\\'ve led a\\n>good life.\\n\\nWhy would you want to live a good life?\\nTo you, you die and that\\'s it.  Don\\'t contradict yourself.  You have\\nno reason to live a good life.  It doesn\\'t do you any good in the\\nend.  Your life doesn\\'t do anybody else any good  either because\\neveryone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading\\na good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\\n\\n>I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god\\n>I\\'d worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in\\n>which case it\\'s not really all that important.\\n\\nHas the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.\\nJesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system\\nin its every detail.  Jesus\\'s death was like a seed.  He needed\\nto fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did\\nyou miss the entire John passage as well?  \\n\\n\\n>Forget the Bible for a minute.  Forget quoting verses, forget about\\n>who said what about this or that.  *Show me.*  Picture just you and me\\n>and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you\\'re right.\\n\\nForget that I am a person.  Forget that I know how to type.  Forget\\nthat I know how to put a sentence together.  Forget that I know\\nhow to send e-mail.   Forget my existence.  Proove to me that I\\nexist.  .\\n\\n\\nBe honest.\\n',\n",

It was the religion of the great Persian\\nEmpire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ\\nwas born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three\\nZoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,\\nJews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the\\nZoroastrian prophet.\\n\\n   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are \\na miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a\\npeople is very much on their minds.\\n\\n   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance\\nof the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed\\nby nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause\\ntheir young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they\\nactually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children\\nbecome totally assimilated, they say, it\\'s their children - rather than\\nthe world at large - who will be the losers.\\n\\n   \"It\\'s important to have an identity,\" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,\\na leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  \"It\\'s important\\nfor everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.\\nYou don\\'t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.\\nYou can fall back on your own identity.\"\\n\\n   For Zoroastrians, there\\'s much to be proud of.\\n\\n   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which\\nanimal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was\\nonly one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which\\ntranslates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.\\n\\n_Good vs. evil_\\n\\n   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with\\nthe good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for\\ngood, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences\\nsuch as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,\\nkindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of\\nmen and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.\\n\\n   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to\\nfollow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,\\nJoseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,\\ntraced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.\\n\\n   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a\\nstained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of\\nMount Hamilton, is \"Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.\"\\n\\n   So it\\'s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,\\nwhere a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape\\npersecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;\\nthe overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.\\n\\n   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India\\nand Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from\\nIran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state\\nwhere others had no rights.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on \"good\\ndeeds\" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,\\nthe recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because\\nManou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up\\ndowntown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple\\'s\\ndedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the\\nZoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\n   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an\\nIranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples\\nin North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount\\nHamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,\\nand Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on\\nthis continent.\\n\\n   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the\\nproperty already had a large house that they have converted to a\\ncommunity center.\\n\\n   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet \\nZoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted \\nceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.\\n\\n   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-\\nin area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are \\nsometimes called \"fire worshippers,\" they actually consider fire just \\na symbol of God.  \"It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the \\ncross and Muslims use the Holy Book,\" Bhujwala said.\\n\\n   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all\\nIranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of\\nthe season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With\\nZoroaster\\'s birthday just six days later, the combination of religious\\nand secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the\\nUnited States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.\\n\\n  For this year\\'s celebration of the prophet\\'s birthday, about 500 people\\ncame to worship and revel.\\n\\n   \"The good things in life are not forbidden,\" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,\\na leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed\\nproved him right.\\n\\n   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood\\naround the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted\\nthanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking\\nsandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit\\nand nuts.\\n\\n   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  \"People eat the\\nfruit,\" Tarapore said.  \"It\\'s a way to participate in the ceremony.\"\\n\\n_Santa Claus, sort of_\\n\\n   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white\\nhair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green\\nsymbolic of spring) and red.\\n\\n   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and\\nplayed a tambourine.\\n\\n   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  \"This is all new for us, too,\"\\none told a visitor who asked what was going on.\\n\\n   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with\\nthe religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have\\nno procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their\\ncenturies of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu\\nking who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his\\npeople\\'s religion.\\n\\n   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the\\nSan Jose temple whenever he can.\\n\\n   \"When I first heard about this religion,\" he said, \"I thought, my God,\\nthis is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.\\n\\n   \"People who don\\'t have a tradition, something to lean on, what\\'s the\\ndifference with the lower animals?\"\\n\\n------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- \\n',\n",
